Demos for my session about Deploying models to production with TensorFlow Serving. I would urge you to check out 
[talks.md](https://github.com/Rishit-dagli/GDG-Ahmedabad-2020/blob/master/talks.md) for more details and the talks I have given about this. I would also urge you to check out the 
[blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/deploying-models-to-production-with-tensorflow-model-server-225a81859031) by me on the same.
